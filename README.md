# AWS-S3-multipart-upload
Multipart Upload which allows faster, more flexible uploads into Amazon S3. 
Multipart Upload allows you to upload a single object as a set of parts.

Multipart uploading is a three-step process: You initiate the upload, you upload the object parts, and after you have uploaded all the parts, you complete the multipart upload
